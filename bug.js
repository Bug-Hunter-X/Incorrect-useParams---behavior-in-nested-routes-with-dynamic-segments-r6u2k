In React Router Dom v6, an uncommon error arises when using nested routes with dynamic segments and the `useParams` hook.  If a parent route has a dynamic segment, and a child route also has a dynamic segment, the child's `useParams` hook may not correctly reflect the dynamic segments from both parent and child routes. This can lead to incorrect data fetching or rendering.

Example:

```jsx
<Route path="/:parentId/child/:childId" element={<ChildPage />}>
```

In `ChildPage`, `useParams()` might only return `{childId}` and omit `{parentId}` causing issues.
